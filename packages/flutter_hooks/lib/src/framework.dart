/// [Hook] is similar to a [StatelessWidget], but is not associated

///
/// A [Hook] is typically the equivalent of [State] for [StatefulWidget],
/// with the notable difference that a [HookWidget] can have more than one [Hook].
/// A [Hook] is created within the [HookState.build] method of [HookWidget] and the creation
/// must be made unconditionally, always in the same order.
///
/// ### Good:
/// ```
/// class Good extends HookWidget {
///   @override
///   Widget build(BuildContext context) {
///     final name = useState("");
///     // ...
///   }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ### Bad:
/// ```
/// class Bad extends HookWidget {
///   @override
///   Widget build(BuildContext context) {
///     if (condition) {
///       final name = useState("");
///       // ...
///     }
///   }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// The reason for such restriction is that [HookState] are obtained based on their index.
/// So the index must never ever change, or it will lead to undesired behavior.
///
/// ## The usage
///
/// [Hook] is powerful tool to reuse [State] logic between multiple [Widget].
/// They are used to extract logic that depends on a [Widget] life-cycle (such as [HookState.dispose]).
///
/// While mixins are a good candidate too, they do not allow sharing values. A mixin cannot reasonnably
/// define a variable, as this can lead to variable conflicts on bigger widgets.
///
/// Hooks are designed so that they get the benefits of mixins, but are totally independent from each others.
/// This means that hooks can store and expose values without fearing that the name is already taken by another mixin.
///
/// ## Example
///
/// A common use-case is to handle disposable objects such as [AnimationController].
///
/// With the usual [StatefulWidget], we would typically have the following:
///
/// ```
/// class Usual extends StatefulWidget {
///   @override
///   _UsualState createState() => _UsualState();
/// }
///
/// class _UsualState extends State<Usual>
///     with SingleTickerProviderStateMixin {
///   late final _controller = AnimationController(
///     vsync: this,
///     duration: const Duration(seconds: 1),
///   );
///
///   @override
///   void dispose() {
///     _controller.dispose();
///     super.dispose();
///   }
///
///   @override
///   Widget build(BuildContext context) {
///     return Container();
///   }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// This is undesired because every single widget that want to use an [AnimationController] will have to
/// rewrite this extact piece of code.
///
/// With hooks it is possible to extract that exact piece of code into a reusable one.
///
/// This means that with [HookWidget] the following code is equivalent to the previous example:
///
/// ```
/// class Usual extends HookWidget {
///   @override
///   Widget build(BuildContext context) {
///     final animationController = useAnimationController(duration: const Duration(seconds: 1));
///     return Container();
///   }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// This is visibly less code then before. But in this example, the `animationController` is still
/// guaranted to be disposed when the widget is removed from the tree.
///
/// In fact this has secondary bonus: `duration` is kept updated with the latest value.
/// If we were to pass a variable as `duration` instead of a constant, then on value change the [AnimationController] will be updated.
