# Flutter Hooks

A Flutter implementation of React hooks: https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/making-sense-of-react-hooks-fdbde8803889

Hooks are a new kind of object that manage the life-cycle of a `Widget`. They exist
for one reason: increase the code-sharing _between_ widgets by removing duplicates.

## Motivation

`StatefulWidget` suffers from a big problem: it is very difficult to reuse the
logic of say `initState` or `dispose`. An obvious example is `AnimationController`:

```dart
class Example extends StatefulWidget {
  const Example({super.key, required this.duration});

  final Duration duration;

  @override
  _ExampleState createState() => _ExampleState();
}

class _ExampleState extends State<Example> with SingleTickerProviderStateMixin {
  late final AnimationController _controller;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _controller = AnimationController(vsync: this, duration: widget.duration);
  }

  @override
  void didUpdateWidget(Example oldWidget) {
    super.didUpdateWidget(oldWidget);
    if (widget.duration != oldWidget.duration) {
      _controller.duration = widget.duration;
    }
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    _controller.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Container();
  }
}
```

All widgets that desire to use an `AnimationController` will have to reimplement
almost all of this logic from scratch, which is of course undesired.

Dart mixins can partially solve this issue, but they suffer from other problems:

- A given mixin can only be used once per class.
- Mixins and the class share the same object.\
  This means that if two mixins define a variable under the same name, the result
  may vary between compilation fails to unknown behavior.

---

This library proposes a third solution:

```dart
class Example extends HookWidget {
  const Example({super.key, required this.duration});

  final Duration duration;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    final controller = useAnimationController(duration: duration);
    return Container();
  }
}
```

This code is functionally equivalent to the previous example. It still disposes the
`AnimationController` and still updates its `duration` when `Example.duration` changes.
But you're probably thinking:

> Where did all the logic go?

That logic has been moved into `useAnimationController`, a function included directly in
this library (see [Existing hooks](https://github.com/rrousselGit/flutter_hooks#existing-hooks)) - It is what we call a _Hook_.

Hooks are a new kind of object with some specificities:

- They can only be used in the `build` method of a widget that mix-in `Hooks`.
- The same hook can be reused arbitrarily many times.
  The following code defines two independent `AnimationController`, and they are
  correctly preserved when the widget rebuild.

  ```dart
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    final controller = useAnimationController();
    final controller2 = useAnimationController();
    return Container();
  }
  ```

- Hooks are entirely independent of each other and from the widget.\
  This means that they can easily be extracted into a package and published on
  [pub](https://pub.dev/) for others to use.

## Principle

Similar to `State`, hooks are stored in the `Element` of a `Widget`. However, instead
of having one `State`, the `Element` stores a `List<Hook>`. Then in order to use a `Hook`,
one must call `Hook.use`.

The hook returned by `use` is based on the number of times it has been called.
The first call returns the first hook; the second call returns the second hook,
the third call returns the third hook and so on.

If this idea is still unclear, a naive implementation of hooks could look as follows:

```dart
class HookElement extends Element {
  List<HookState> _hooks;
  int _hookIndex;

  T use<T>(Hook<T> hook) => _hooks[_hookIndex++].build(this);

  @override
  performRebuild() {
    _hookIndex = 0;
    super.performRebuild();
  }
}
```

For more explanation of how hooks are implemented, here's a great article about
how it was done in React: https://medium.com/@ryardley/react-hooks-not-magic-just-arrays-cd4f1857236e

## Rules

Due to hooks being obtained from their index, some rules must be respected:

### DO always prefix your hooks with `use`:

```dart
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  // starts with `use`, good name
  useMyHook();
  // doesn't start with `use`, could confuse people into thinking that this isn't a hook
  myHook();
  // ....
}
```

### DO call hooks unconditionally

```dart
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  useMyHook();
  // ....
}
```

### DON'T wrap `use` into a condition

```dart
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  if (condition) {
    useMyHook();
  }
  // ....
}
```

---

### About hot-reload

Since hooks are obtained from their index, one may think that hot-reloads while refactoring will break the application.

But worry not, a `HookWidget` overrides the default hot-reload behavior to work with hooks. Still, there are some situations in which the state of a Hook may be reset.

Consider the following list of hooks:

```dart
useA();
useB(0);
useC();
```

Then consider that we edited the parameter of `HookB` after performing a hot-reload:

```dart
useA();
useB(42);
useC();
```

Here everything works fine and all hooks maintain their state.

Now consider that we removed `HookB`. We now have:

```dart
useA();
useC();
```

In this situation, `HookA` maintains its state but `HookC` gets hard reset.
This happens because, when a hot-reload is performed after refactoring, all hooks _after_ the first line impacted are disposed of.
So, since `HookC` was placed _after_ `HookB`, it will be disposed.

## How to create a hook

There are two ways to create a hook:

- A function

  Functions are by far the most common way to write hooks. Thanks to hooks being
  composable by nature, a function will be able to combine other hooks to create
  a more complex custom hook. By convention, these functions will be prefixed by `use`.

  The following code defines a custom hook that creates a variable and logs its value
  to the console whenever the value changes:

  ```dart
  ValueNotifier<T> useLoggedState<T>([T initialData]) {
    final result = useState<T>(initialData);
    useValueChanged(result.value, (_, __) {
      print(result.value);
    });
    return result;
  }
  ```

- A class

  When a hook becomes too complex, it is possible to convert it into a class that extends `Hook` - which can then be used using `Hook.use`.\
  As a class, the hook will look very similar to a `State` class and have access to widget
  life-cycle and methods such as `initHook`, `dispose` and `setState`.

  It is usually good practice to hide the class under a function as such:

  ```dart
  Result useMyHook() {
    return use(const _TimeAlive());
  }
  ```

  The following code defines a hook that prints the total time a `State` has been alive on its dispose.

  ```dart
  class _TimeAlive extends Hook<void> {
    const _TimeAlive();

    @override
    _TimeAliveState createState() => _TimeAliveState();
  }

  class _TimeAliveState extends HookState<void, _TimeAlive> {
    DateTime start;

    @override
    void initHook() {
      super.initHook();
      start = DateTime.now();
    }

    @override
    void build(BuildContext context) {}

    @override
    void dispose() {
      print(DateTime.now().difference(start));
      super.dispose();
    }
  }
  ```

## Existing hooks

Flutter_Hooks already comes with a list of reusable hooks which are divided into different kinds:

### Primitives

A set of low-level hooks that interact with the different life-cycles of a widget

## Contributions

Contributions are welcomed!

If you feel that a hook is missing, feel free to open a pull-request.

For a custom-hook to be merged, you will need to do the following:

- Describe the use-case.

  Open an issue explaining why we need this hook, how to use it, ...
  This is important as a hook will not get merged if the hook doesn't appeal to
  a large number of people.

  If your hook is rejected, don't worry! A rejection doesn't mean that it won't
  be merged later in the future if more people show interest in it.
  In the mean-time, feel free to publish your hook as a package on https://pub.dev.

- Write tests for your hook

  A hook will not be merged unless fully tested to avoid inadvertently breaking it
  in the future.

- Add it to the README and write documentation for it.
